# alpini-algorithms-project

Group project assinged during the Algorithms and Data Structures course in 2018.

The assingment document (in Italian) is available in the repo.

The problem was solvable through Dynamic Programming techniques, we managed to find a solution with a 3-dimensional matrix, 
there was a better 2-dimensional solution but no group in our course managed to find it.
